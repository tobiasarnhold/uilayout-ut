# UILayout - UT

<h3>What is it?</h3>

A lot of people like the "Page Designer" functionality to change the size of the different areas by using some moving bars.<br>
This plugin is using a jQuery solution called "UI Layout" which provides a great API to master the layout for feature-rich cross-platform web applications.<br>
What this plugin is doing. It takes the abilities of "UI Layout" and brings in those features into the new "APEX Universal Theme".<br>
What you get is the power of the responsive "Universal Theme" including new moving abilities to handle all kind of complex application features like toolbars, menus, help-panels, status bars more easily.<br>
